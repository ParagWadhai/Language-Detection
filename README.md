# Language-Detection
Building a language detection system using a dataset of text samples in different languages involves utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms. The dataset, sourced from GitHub or similar repositories, contains text samples written in various languages. By preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features, and employing techniques, you can train a classifier, such as a multinomial Naive Bayes or logistic regression model, to accurately predict the language of a given text sample. This system can be useful for applications like language identification in multilingual text processing or content localization on websites and platforms.
